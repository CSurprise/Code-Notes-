    <h1> The Basics of HTML</h1>
      <p>HTML-Hyper Text Markup Language</p>
      <p>The language used to create the web pages you visit everyday.
      (It is a logical way to structure content for webpages.)</p>
      <p>A Markup Language is a computer language that defines the structure
      and presentation of raw text</p>
      <p> "!doctype html" *** This must be at the beginning to help the server
      identify the html file</p>
      <p> After beginning the code with "!doctype html" we must add "html" and
      closing of the file with "/html" or else the code wil not show up</p>
  </div>

    <h1> Standardized Vocab </h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Angle Brackets- In HTML, the characters < and > are known as angle
      brackets</li>
      <li>Element- The code that lives inside of the < > angle brackets</li>
      <li>Opening Tag- The first opening tag to start an HTML element</li>
      <li>Closing Tag- The second (or closing) tag used to end an HTML element
        closing tags have a forward slash inside of them.</li>
      <p>Example: Opening "html" Closing "/html"</p>
      <li>Attribute- Provides even more info. about an elements content. They
      live in the opening tag of an element.</li>
      <p>Attributes are made of two things, the value and the name of the
        attribute</p>
      <li>Hyperlink- A link</li>
      <li>Type- Describes the document you are linking to. Ex. Value=text/css</li>
      <li>rel- Describes the relationship between the 2 files, (If you are linking
        to a style sheet like CSS the value is stylesheet) Ex. rel=stylesheet</li>
      <li>UX= User-Experience</li>
      <li>Foreground- the element.</li>
      <li>Background- behind the element</li>
      <li>Typography- The art of writing</li>
      <li>Serif: The letters in these fonts have extra details on the ends
      of each letter and traditionally used in print designs.</li>
      <li>Sans-Serif: Letters do not have extra details just straight flat edges.
      This looks better on low-resolution screens</li>
      <li>Px- Represents the unit of pixels. A pixel is a small point on a
      screen and most monitors have a resolution of 72 pixels per inch. Making a pixel 1/72 of an in.
    <br>p {font-size: 18px;}</li>
      <li>em- pronounced just as it looks, "em". A em is equal to the width of the letter
    m. Ems are a relative unit of measurement. They change the size of text
  relative to the parent element's size of text <br> p {font-size: 1.3em;}</li>

    <h1>Web Browser Basics</h1>
      <p>Must have a "head" to show what page you are on. Once you have a "head"
      put in  "title" whatever "/title" </p>
      <p>Then in order for things to appear on the website a "body" is required
      "body" Fluff "/body"</p>
    <h1>HTML Elements</h1>
    <h3>Heading sizes</h3>
      <p>There are multiple heading sizes that can be used on a webpage in
      HTML. They range from H1 to H6 from largest to smallest</p>
      <p>Headers are usually used to grasp a readers attention with a few words.
      If you want to put words in paragrapgh format use "p". This is great for
    expanding the amount of words on your webpage. </p>
    <h3>Lists</h3>
      <p>Often times you will want to display content in a list. Im HTML you
      will want to use an unordered list "ul" for bullet points or an ordered
    "ol" for numbered</p>
      <p>However these elements cannot hold raw text and cannot format text
      because of this</p>
      <p>Individual list items must be added to the list by using the listed
      item element "li"</p>
    <h3>Hyper-Links</h3>
      <p>you can add links to a webpage by adding the anchor element "a" with
      URL in between the opening and closing tag</p>
      <p>However! You can not use the anchor element and expect the link to work
      without an attribute. The href attribute</p>
      <p>For anchor elements (a hyperlink), name of the attribute is href and
      it's value must be set to the URL of the page you'd like the user to
    visit</p>
    <p>Example: "a href=https://www.wikipedia.org" this is wikipedia! "/a"</p>
    <p>For a link that leads to a different window/tab, we use the target attribute.
    </p>
    <p>The target attribute requires a value of _blank . Like all attributes
    this should be in the opening tag of your anchor element</p>
    <p>For example: "a href=https://www.wikipedia.org target=_blank" Wiki! "/a"</p>
    <h3>Pictures</h3>
    <p>If we wanted images? we would use the image element "img/" this element
       is special because it is self closing</p>
    <p>The image element requires the element src (sort of like href) with the
    value = to the URL of the picture</p>
    <p>"img src=https://picture.url /"</p>
    <h3>Visually impaired</h3>
    <p>HTML supports the visually impaired with the alt attribute</p>
    <p>The alt attribute is applied specifically to the img element and it's
    value should be a descripton of the picture</p>
    <p>An example would be : "img src=https://SpidermanPicture alt= a picture of
      spiderman /"</p>
    <p>If the image provides no important info. then an alt should not be applied</p>
    <h3>Hyperlinking with Images</h3>
    <p>If we want to add a hyperlink to an image we must put the image element
    INSIDE of the anchor element</p>
    <p>For example: "a href=URL target=_blank" "img src=PictureUrl
      alt=Description /" "/a"</p>
      <a href="https://google.com" target="_blank"> <img src="https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/08-spider-man-2002.jpg?w=300&h=240&crop=1" alt="Spiderman"></a>
      <h3>Spacing</h3>
      <p>In HTML space does nothing except more your site look sexier.</p>
      <p>Even though spacing will ont work in your code, you can space things
      on a webpage by using the line break element "br /" anywhere , <br />
      it is self-closing and will show a line break</p>
      <h3>Comments</h3>
      <p>Comments are specifically for your code and serves for one of two things</p>
      <ol>
        <li>They help you (and others) understand your code and if you decide to
        come back and review it later</li>
        <li>Allow to experiment with new code without deleting the old one</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Putting a comment in your code would look like this "!-- comment --"</p>
      <h1>CSS Coding</h1>
      <p>With the basics of html that we now possess the website will still
      very plain and boring</p>
      <p>To make websites more visually appealing we use CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
      a language used to style HTML content. CSS is used to modify:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>colors</li>
        <li>font type</li>
        <li>font size</li>
        <li>shadows</li>
        <li>images</li>
        <li>element positioning</li>
        <li>Et cetera</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Even though CSS is a different language, it is still possible to use in HTML
      due to the "style" element</p>
      <h3>The Style Element</h3>
      <p>This element allows you to write CSS code between its opening and closing tags</p>
      <p>The style element must be inside the "head", once "style" is placed inside of the web page's
      head, we can begin writing in code</p>
      <p>However, this mixing of code is very confusing and can result in the risk of
      1 or 2 things</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Creating a larg HTML file that is both difficult to read and maintain.
        This could result in inefficient work flow</li>
        <li>Maintaining a clear distinction between web page structure (html) and web page
        aesthetics</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Styling with a CSS file</h3>
      <p>To fix having too much clutter we can seperate the styling (CSS) from
      the index.html file to the style.css file.</p>
      <p>However just putting code in a seperate file will not work, the index
        file must be linked with style.css</p>
      <p>In order to do this we use the "link" element. This has to be put in the
      head of the HTML file, it is a self closing tag and REQUIRES href (like the anchor)
      and the value is = to to the address or path to the CSS file. </p>
      <h3>Linking</h3>
      <p>When linking a html and css file together the "link" element will look
      lke:</p>
      <p>"link href=/style.css type=text/css rel=stylesheet"</p>
      <h3>Actually Styling</h3>
      <p>To first start styling we have an html element we must select the element
      in the css profile</p>
      <p>For example to style a "p" element the syntax in the css would be p { }</p>
      <p>In this example ALL paragraph elements are selected. The seletor is the HTML tag
      (in this case p) but without angle brackets.</p>
      <p>To actually style the element you need to specify two things.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Property- The property you would like to style of the element
        (size, color, font size, etc.)</li>
        <li>Value- The value of the property (18px for size, Blue for color, etc.)</li>
      </ol>
      <p>h1 {color:Blue;}</p>
      <p>h1 is the selector, color is the property, Blue is the value, and the semicolon
      is used to end the declaration</p>
      <p>The line "color:Blue" is a declaration. Declarations consist of a property
      and a value.</p>
      <p>The whole line of code is known as a CSS Rule. A CSS rule consists of
      the selector and all declarations in the selector.</p>
      <h3>Grouping</h3>
      <p>If multiple elements would like to be selected for the same changes
      then simply add them to the selector... h1, p {color:Blue;}</p>
      <p>When all elements on a webpage require the same styling, it is often
      more efficient to set the styling using the universal selector *, Afterwards
    you can modify (or remove) that styling for specific elements that don't require
  it</p>
  <h3>Commenting in CSS</h3>
      <p>Just like HTML you can leave comments in a CSS file</p>
      <p>/* comment */</p>
      <p>This will accomplish the samething html commenting does.</p>
      <h1>Colors</h1>
      <p>There are 2 distinctions between what color will affect.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The foreground color.</li>
        <li>The background color</li>
      </ol>
      <p>In CSS, these 2 designs can be styled by:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>color: This styles an elements foreground.</li>
        <li>background-color: This styles an elements background</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Ex: h1 {color:Red; <br /> background-color:Blue; <br>}</p>
      <p>This is the appropriate way to code in CSS (even though it looks odd)</p>
      <p>There are 147 named colors that can be used just google them.</p>
      <h3>RGB Colors</h3>
      <p>Even though there are only 147 full colors we would not be taking full
      advantage of color without using RGB</p>
      <p>RGB(Red,Green,Blue) offers the option of 16,777,216 million possible colors</p>
      <p>Each color in RGB can be one of 256 possible values. (They range from 0 to 255)</p>
      <p>Ex. h1 {color:rgb(123,20,233);}</p>
      <h3>Hex Color</h3>
      <p>You can also use hex color codes but they are basically the same thing as RGB
      just a different way to write color i.e. h1 {color: #AA33BB or #452F73}</p>
      <h3>HSL</h3>
      <p>A new way to specify colors is through HSL coloring.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Hue: The technical term for color. In HSL, hue is represented on a
        color wheel. It can have values from 0-360</li>
        <li>Saturation: The amount of gray in a given color. In HSL, saturation
        is specified using percents between 0% to 100%, 0% being a very light shade of gray
        and 100% being full saturation</li>
        <li>Lightness: The amount of white in a given color ranging from 0% to
        100%. 0% being black, 50% normal, and 100% white</li>
        <p>For example {color: hsl(182,20%,50%)}</p>
      </ul>
      <h3>Opacity</h3>
      <p>Opacity is the measure of how transparent a color is.</p>
      <p>RGB is very simialar to hex color except RGB can add opacity to it by
      doing rgba() instead of just rgb()</p>
      <p>The a character in rgba is known as the alpha value. It represents the
      opacity of color. The value ranges from 0-1 inclusively</p>
      <p>h1 { color:rgba(123,88,9,.5);}</p>
      <p>the .5 represents 50% opacity which is normal color. </p>
      <p>Opacity can also be used with HSLA</p>
      <h3>Browser issues</h3>
      <p>Not all browsers cn support all the fancy things of CSS. (Such as opacity)</p>
      <p>Because of this we make backups for the file to read. <br>
      i.e. h1 {rgb(1,2,3) <br> rgba(1,2,3,.4)}</p>
      <p>The browser will always read the last line and if it cannot then it
      will open the line of code before it. A.K.A. the backup</p>
      <h3>Font</h3>
      <div class="font">
      <p>The phrase "Type of Font" refers to the technical term typeface, or font
      family. <br> To change the type of font we use:</p>
      <p>Example: h1 {font-family:Garamond;}<br> name of the font is always capital
      and when using a font with more than one word the words are in quotation i.e.
    "Times New Roman"</p>
    <p>When setting new font it is important to keep this in mind</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The font specified must be installed on the user's computer in order
      for the font to display.</li>
      <li>the default typeface for HTML is Times New Roman.</li>
      <li>It is good practice to limit the number of typefaces to 2 or 3 on a site.</li>
    </ol>
    <p> Like color, sometimes a browser cannot open certain fonts and fallback
    fonts are needed. Most computers only hsve a few pre-installed fonts.</p>
    <p>To use fall-back fonts, the following syntax is required: <br> h1 {font-family: Garamond, Times, serif;}</p>
    <p>The rule above states to use Garamond font, if that is not availabe
    then uses the Times font, if that is not availabe use any serif font pre-installed
    on the computer </p>
    <p>Luckily new fonts are constantly being centralized in directories available
    for public use. </p>
    <p>For example: With google fonts you can use the URL for a certain font
    and link it to make it available to use.</p>
    <p>"head"<br>"link href=font.url type=text/css rel=stylesheet" "/head"</p>
    <p>This makes the font of the URL available to use in CSS as you normally would</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Font Size</h3>
    <p>Another way to customize font is through it's size. <br> p {font-size: 18px;} </p>
    <p>In the example font size is set to 18px. px is a unit of measurement such as ft or in. px is for pixels</p>
    <h3>Line Spacing</h3>
    <p>To avoid words being too closely cluttered together and hard to read we have "line-height"
    to modify the spacing between lines of text <br>p {line-height:1.5em;}</p>
    <p>When the line height of an element is modified, you are manipulating
    the leading (pronounced ledding) of the font. When the line height is increased,
    the spacing between lines of text increases, which can make text easier to read.</p>
    <p>Line height can be modified with px or ems but ems are preferred</p>
    <h3>Spacing in general</h3>
    <p>You can also space words or letters in the same way as line spacing by
    using the "word-spacing" or "letter-spacing" properties</p>
    <p>The default space between words in .25em but it is not common to increase the length</p>
    <p>Also changing the length of letter spacing is called kerning</p>
    <h3>Text</h3>
    <p>A common practice found on websites is bolding.</p>
    <p id="bold">In CSS the "font-weight" property turns boldness on or off <br>
    p {font-weight: bold;} or p {font-weight: normal;}</p>
    <p>We can also change boldness using numbers starting from 100 every 100 to 900</p>
    <p id="italic">You can also italicize words with the font-style property <br> h3 {font-style: italic or normal;}</p>
    <p>Or you can change letters from all uppercare or lowercase with the text-transform property
    <br> h1 {text-transfrom:uppercase or lowercase;}</p>
    <p>Text will always appear on the left side but to be moved use "text-align" <br>
    h1 {text-align:left center or right;}</p>
